      I was working as the only front end developer of the team, being able to deploy 
      in a year 4 different apps and support the old applications. My work was always 
      prized for the intuitive and nice styling and for the fast development with 
      minimal quantity of errors and zero critical bugs.
      
      Salesforce Developer and Administration:
      Salesforce uses Unit Testing as a developing methodology, with a code
      coverage of 75% required to implement development in production.
      The working schema was the following:

      High importance to styling and responsive apps
      Builder classes for tests

      The most successful application was a gantt used to manage projects, 
      setting the due dates, managers and child projects. The data 
      had a great visualization, being able to drag the bars in the timeline. 
      The app was awarded and deployed to the instances of China and Australia, 
      not only South American region.
